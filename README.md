# StockPriceMonitor
Monitor stock prices in real-time, identify price anomalies, and send alerts when prices cross certain thresholds.

# Purpose
I wanted a project to learn more about Kafka and Terraform. This should keep it interesting while I do that. And who knows, maybe it will actually be useful!

# Stack
 Java, Kafka, AWS SNS (for alerts), Terraform, and a free stock price API like Alpha Vantage  or Twelve Data to get real-time or near-real-time stock prices.
